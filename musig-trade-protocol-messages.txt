MuSig trade protocol txs
========================

* There is a DepositTx with buyer & seller (payout) outputs (one each, multisig
  & keyspend only), along with buyer & seller inputs & optional change outputs;

* There is a buyer's WarningTx & a seller's WarningTx, each with two inputs
  spending the DepositTx (payout) outputs, and each with one multisig output
  (with one keyspend & one script spend path) and one fee bump output;

* There is a buyer's RedirectTx & a seller's RedirectTx, each with one input
  from the peer's multisig WarningTx output, any number of donation / BM
  outputs and one fee bump output;

* There is a SwapTx with one input spending the DepositTx seller payout and one
  output controlled by the seller;

* Signed claim txs can be created dynamically, which use the WarningTx script
  spend path, with a time delay enforced by OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.

All spends are keyspends apart from those of the claim txs.


Trade protocol messages
=======================

* Four messages A, B, C & D are needed to set up the trade;

* Buyer message E confirms sending of fiat/altcoin payment and allows seller to
  release (through SwapTx or message F);

* Seller message F confirms receipt of fiat/altcoin payment and releases buyer
  payout;

* Buyer courtesy message G closes trade and releases seller payout without
  requiring SwapTx broadcast (should be sent as soon as the buyer goes online
  and picks up message F, hopefully immediately after F is sent).
